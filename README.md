# Attack surface service - exercise

## Description

You should build a service that can resolve the attack surface of a VM;
meaning which other virtual machines in the account can access and attack it.

## Details

### Cloud environment

The input for your service is a JSON document describing the cloud environment of a customer.
A cloud environment is described using 2 types of objects: VMs and firewall rules.
The structure of the cloud environment JSON is:
```
{
  "vms": [ virtual machines ],
  "fw_rules": [ firewall rules ]
}
```
### Virtual Machine

A virtual machine has the following structure:
```
{
  "vm_id": "vm-xxxxxxx",
  "name": "jira server",
  "tags": ["tag1", ..]
}
```

 * vm_id - an identifier that uniquely identifies a virtual machines  
 * name - a user-friendly display name  
 * tags - a list of zero or more tag strings

### Firewall Rule

By default, a virtual machine has no access from external sources.
If an administrator wants to make a virtual machine accessible to other machines, it defines a firewall rule to allow traffic

Firewall rules have the following structure:
```
{
  "fw_id": "fw-xxxxx",
  "source_tag": "tag1",
  "dest_tag": "tag2"
}
```

 * fw_id - an identifier that uniquely identifies a firewall rule
 * source_tag - a string that represents the source tag of a traffic
 * dest_tag - a string that represents the destination tag of a traffic

In the example above, all traffic from virtual machines that have "tag1" is allowed to virtual machines that have "tag2".

A few notes:
 * Virtual machines with the same tag canâ€™t access each other unless there is a firewall rule
explicitly allowing that.
 * The firewall rules are not transitive, meaning that if A can access B and B can access C, it doesn't mean that A is able to access C.

### Your goal:

Build a service that has two REST endpoints:
 * /attack - which will get a **vm_id** as a query parameter and return a JSON list of the
virtual machine ids that can potentially attack it
 * /stats - which will return service statistics in a JSON format: number of virtual machines in the cloud environment, number of requests to all endpoints & average request processing time (in seconds with a millisecond granularity).  
   Statistics should be from process startup.

Using the attack endpoint via CLI:  
```
$ curl 'http://localhost/api/v1/attack?vm_id=vm-a211de'
["vm-c7bac01a07"]
```

Using the `stats` endpoint via CLI:  
```
$ curl 'http://localhost/api/v1/stats'
{"vm_count":2,"request_count":1120232,"average_request_time":0.68166772597}
```
